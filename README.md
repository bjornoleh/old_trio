# Open-iAPS

## Introduction

Open-iAPS - an automated insulin delivery system for iOS based on the OpenAPS algorithm with [adaptations for Open-iAPS](https://github.com/nightscout/open-iaps-oref).

The project started as Ivan Valkou's FreeAPS X implementation of the OpenAPS algorithm for iPhone, and later forked and rebranded as iAPS.
The project has since seen substantial contributions from many developers, leading to a range of new features and enhancements.

Following the release of version 3.0.0, due to differing views on development, open source, and peer review, there was a significant shift in the project's direction. This led to the separation from the [Artificial-Pancreas/iAPS](https://github.com/Artificial-Pancreas/iAPS) repository, and the birth of Open-iAPS as a distinct entity. This transition marks a new phase for the project, symbolizing both its evolution and the dynamic nature of collaborative development.

Open-iAPS continues to leverage a variety of frameworks from the DIY looping community and remains at the forefront of DIY diabetes management solutions, constantly evolving with valuable contributions from its community.
